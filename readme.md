# SimpleAccountCode 💰

A clean and straightforward C# console application for personal account management. This project focuses on the core logic of banking transactions such as depositing and withdrawing money.

### 🔄 Latest Updates
- **[Dec 27, 2025]** - **Refactored Menu:** Improved control flow by implementing `switch-case` instead of `if-else`.
- **[Dec 27, 2025]** - **String Formatting:** Fixed a verbatim string bug in the menu console output for a cleaner UI.

- **[Dec 25, 2025]** - **UX Flow Improvement**: Enhanced the confirmation logic. Users now remain within the transaction process if they choose "No" instead of being redirected to the main menu.

## 🌟 Features
- **Deposit:** Add funds to your balance.
- **Withdraw:** Securely withdraw money with an automated balance check (prevents negative balance).
- **View Balance:** Instantly check your current account status.
- **User-Friendly Menu:** A continuous loop that allows multiple transactions until you choose to exit.

## 🚀 My Journey & Roadmap
This is my **very first project**, developed just **3 days** after I started learning coding with C#. I am focusing on mastering the fundamentals before moving on to more complex structures.

**Future Goals:**
- [ ] Refactor the code using **OOP (Object Oriented Programming)** principles to make it more modular.
- [ ] Implement a **Transaction History** feature to track past movements.
- [ ] **Ultimate Goal:** Transform this console application into a modern desktop app with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using WinForms or WPF.

## 🤖 Development Process & AI Disclosure
I believe in transparency and the ethical use of technology in the learning process:

- **Core Logic:** The fundamental logic, loops (while), and conditional statements (if-else) were written entirely by me.
- **Language:** I chose to write the code in **English** to align with global programming standards.
- **AI Assistance (Gemini):** I used AI as a **thought partner and mentor**. It helped me understand "Error Handling" (managing invalid inputs) and guided me in structuring this professional README file. I focused on learning the *why* behind the suggestions rather than just copying code.
